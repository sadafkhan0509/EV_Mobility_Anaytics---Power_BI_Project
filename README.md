# EV_Mobility_Anaytics---Power_BI_Project

I recently designed an end-to-end Power BI dashboard suite covering key aspects of an EV mobility platform.
📊 Note: The data used here is sample data for demonstration purposes, but the dashboards reflect the same structure, logic, and insights I work on monthly in my role as a Data Analyst.


# 📌 Customer Dashboard
This dashboard provides a 360° view of customer engagement:

- Monthly trends of customer registrations vs vehicle registrations
- State-wise customer distribution
- Weekday-wise registration behavior
- Key KPIs like total customers, trip planners, navigators, and check-ins.
  
👉 Helps business teams understand **who the users are and how they engage.**

# 🚘 Vehicle Dashboard

# 🛣️ Trip Dashboard
Analyzes trip behavior and planning efficiency:

- Monthly trip status (completed, ongoing, unsuccessful, saved)
